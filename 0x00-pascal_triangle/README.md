# Pascal's Triangle Project

Welcome to the **Pascal's Triangle Project**! This project is a part of the Short Specializations curriculum aimed at enhancing your understanding of algorithms and Python programming. 

## Project Overview

### Objective

Create a function `def pascal_triangle(n):` that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s Triangle for a given integer `n`.

### Requirements

- Returns an empty list if `n <= 0`.
- You can assume `n` will always be an integer.

### Timeline

- **Project Start:** July 22, 2024, 6:00 AM UTC
- **Project End:** July 26, 2024, 6:00 AM UTC
- **Checker Release:** July 23, 2024, 6:00 AM UTC
- **Auto Review Launch:** At the project deadline

## Must Know Concepts

To successfully complete this project, you should be comfortable with the following Python concepts:

1. **Lists and List Comprehensions**
   - Creation, access, modification, and iteration.

2. **Functions**
   - Defining and calling functions, passing parameters, and returning values.

3. **Loops**
   - Using `for` and `while` loops, including nested loops.

4. **Conditional Statements**
   - Using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

5. **Recursion (Optional)**
   - Understanding base and recursive cases for alternative approaches.

6. **Arithmetic Operations**
   - Implementing addition for calculating elements of the triangle.

7. **Indexing and Slicing**
   - Accessing and utilizing lists for constructing rows.

8. **Memory Management**
   - Managing list storage efficiently.

9. **Error and Exception Handling (Optional)**
   - Using `try-except` blocks for handling exceptions.

10. **Efficiency and Optimization**
    - Considering time and space complexity.

## Task Description

### 0. Pascal's Triangle (Mandatory)

Create a function that takes an integer `n` and generates Pascal's Triangle.

### Example Usage

You can test your implementation with the provided sample main script, which demonstrates how to print the triangle.

### Expected Output

For the input `n = 5`, the output should show the first five rows of Pascal's Triangle.
